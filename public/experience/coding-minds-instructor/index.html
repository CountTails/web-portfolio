Fostering Programming in the Youth During my final year of schooling, I took a position to teach the basic a programming to younger students. These students were typically in elementary school age. A few students were middle or high school age. My role as a leading instructor had me teach and explain the basic of many programming topic. As the learning process is much different between young children and college students, the courses focused more on getting the children to write code that would work quickly."/>

<p>During my final year of schooling, I took a position to teach the basic a programming to younger students. These students were typically in elementary school age. A few students were middle or high school age. My role as a leading instructor had me teach and explain the basic of many programming topic. As the learning process is much different between young children and college students, the courses focused more on getting the children to write code that would work quickly. A few higher level concepts were sprinkled throughout, but were not the main focuse of courses.</p>
<p>This position taught me quite a bit about communication with other parties. In my course work, it is assumed that the people we communicate with a well versed or similarly informed about the topic at hand. In the real world, that is rarely the case. As my audience was composed of young students, my tactics of explaining topics was vastly different that explaining something to a professor, or a fellow student in myown courses. Moreover, with every student, the tactics had to be slightly adjusted to suit the particular student. There was no one-size-fits-all way to present content to all of the young students I worked with. Some students sucked up knowledge really quickly, while others were a little slower to pick things up. Overall, this position opened my perspective to communicating to parties of different knowledge. It tought me to formulate techical thoughts in simple, easy to understand terms.</p>
<p>The content the students learned at this institution was very introductory in most cases, but a few individual projects and one-on-one courses were offered. Most classes only had 2-3 students at a time. The topics taught ranged from writing scripts in Minecraft and roblox to learning about the internet to build websites and use APIs to fetch data from different sources. For students will a little more experience, they could also take individual project classes, where they decide what they want to build, and based on their current skillset, we guide them through the build process and introduce concepts as needed by the project.</p>
