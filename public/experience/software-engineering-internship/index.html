<h3 id="some-real-world-experience">Some Real World Experience</h3>
<p>The summer between my third and fourth year of college, I applied for and was accepted for an internship at Box. During my short tenure at the company, I was part of the MySQL engineering team. This team is responsible for managing and automating various processes and services that makeup the database infrastructure that supports the company.</p>
<p>The internship was designed to have me work on a singular project throughout the 12 week program. The project would be supported by a more seasoned member of the staff and the manager. Through this project, I learned many thing about real world software engineering that was not covered in my coursework.</p>
<p>The most glaring difference between course work and real world work is the use of version control for collaboration. At Box, git was widely used and provides many useful tool to ensure working together is less painful than it should be. This is quite a constrast to coursework up to that point as coursework was completely independent and collaboration is frowned upon.</p>
<p>This internship also taught me about packaging up software for use beyond my local machine. The language I used during the project was Python, so the packaging tools and techniques centered around there. Although, it did open my eyes to properly packaging together software so that it could easily be distributed and deployed to other machines.</p>
<p>Overall, this internship provided my first look into what I would possibly be doing after graduated from college. I find the work to be very satisfying, even if the work was challenging beyond anything that I had covered in my coursework. This experience reaffirmed everything that had happened prior is all for preparing for the future that I decided I wanted all the way back in high school.</p>
