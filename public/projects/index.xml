Cumulative practice This is the final project that I worked on during my college career. It came at the end of the final year of my schooling and would be a cumulative way to demonstrate project management, software design and implementation, and soft skills. The project was not provided by a the school or an internal source. Instead, a project sponsor was recruited to provide a unique and challenging project for us to complete.</description>

Advanced software design project This project involved designing a software library that could be used to build tile matching games. The library needed to be extensible to cover both real-time and turn-based tile matching games. The final application needed to support multiplayer versions of tile-matching games, and provide a way to determine a winner and loser of each match.
This project was designed and implemented completely with in-house software.</description>

Project management During a project management course that I took in my final year of college, I, along with a team, had to come up with a project that we would need to manage. The management course did not require to project to actually be completed, only artifact that demonstrate that the project could be successfully managed. However, a couple of team members decided the project idea sounded interesting enough and took a shot and implementing the project.</description>

Using new skills The first real programming project that I decided to build outside of my course work was a calculator. This would eventually end up being a scientific calculator. By including functions like trigonometry and roots, this projects differs from the more straight forward desk calculator that one might find. Additionally, this project would also be my first experience with complex GUI creation.
I began working on this project during the summer between my first and second year of college.</description>
