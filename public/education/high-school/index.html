The start of a journey From August 2015 for May 2019, I attended Loara HS in Anaheim, California. This time was filled with discovering new knowledge and and subjects. As with most people at this age, I had yet to consider what I wanted to do after high school. Fortunately, that question would be answered long before I graduated.
In the first two years, I began to believe that I would be doing something related to mathematics."/>

<h3 id="the-start-of-a-journey">The start of a journey</h3>
<p>From August 2015 for May 2019, I attended <a href="https://loara.auhsd.us">Loara HS</a> in Anaheim, California. This time was filled with discovering new knowledge and and subjects. As with most people at this age, I had yet to consider what I wanted to do after high school. Fortunately, that question would be answered long before I graduated.</p>
<p>In the first two years, I began to believe that I would be doing something related to mathematics. During this time, I excelled in the honors math classes offered by the school. I even felt very comfortable assisting friends and other classmates with homework problems and reviewing for tests. Perhaps, I would end up being a math teacher. This would further solidified as a possible career path when at the end of my second year, I was offered the chance to skip the pre-calculus course and jump straight into AP calculus. While normally reserved for the seniors of the school, every year a few students are selected to join them.</p>
<p>This path into a math related career was becoming clearer and clearer as my third year began. However, I also signed up to take another niche course: AP computer science principles. Although this course started out quite slow and a bit boring for my initial liking, it wasn&rsquo;t until we started exploring programming topics and doing programming exercises that I decided that this is what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>How did I know? While, I may have add a knack for my math classes and helping other student with them, I never really expored it beyond the classroom. With programming, I decided to explore things a little more that just doing the classwork. When we first learned about HTML and CSS in the course, it was just before winter break began. During winter break, I spend quite a bit of time tinkering around with HTML elements and CSS rules that we had not covered in class. I had even began exploring what JavaScript could do for a webpage. This was the first time I had ever gone above and beyond in a course not just because I needed to pass it, but because I genuinely enjoyed what I was learning. Needless to say, I passed the AP exam with flying colors.</p>
<p>Sadly, this was the only computer science course offered by my high school. For my fourt and final year, I went back to exceeding expectations in my math courses (which of course had a much more varied offering) and helping out classmates. However, that never changed my mind about the software developer career path. Even as course load ate up more and more of my time and left me with no time to tinker, I still knew what I wanted to do. So, when it came time to apply for colleges, I made sure to check off the computer science box on all of my applications as my first choice major.</p>
