<p>From September 2019 to June 2023 I attended the University of California, Irvine (<a href="https://uci.edu">UCI</a>). Upon admission, I was accepted as a computer science major. However, I would eventually transition to become a Software Engineering major. The two majors are quite similar. They share many of the same courses and have a strong focus on the theoretical aspects of their respective fields. The biggest difference that sets them apart is the way that the content is taught. As a software engineering major, I learned about the same things that a computer science major would learn, but through the lens of building functional software.</p>
<p>The first term of college was arguably quite similar to high school. This is likely due to my experience with AP classes and high school, so I knew the kind of work that would be expected of me in order to succeed. The biggest difference was that classes were not an everyday thing. Interestingly, it was this term of school that completely shut down any ambition I had to pursue a career in a mathematical field. The exposure the multivariable calculus in this term made math feel as though it was getting old. By the start of the second term, I submitted and application to change my major to software engineering.</p>
<p>Near the end of the second term, the covid-19 pandemic struck in full force. As with many education institution, UCI completely flipped the switch on the format of courses and everything became remote. The remainder of this school year and the next would be online. Network wise, this would end up shattering any connections or friendships that I had made during the first two quarters.</p>
<p>During these difficult times, I also learned about a peer tutoring program that was offered by successful students in lower division courses. Since the task seemed quite similar to what I did in high school to help out classmates, I decided to give it a try. I instantly felt the high of helping another student debug their code or understand a topic or concept that had alluded them when the professor(s) explained. Throughout the pandemic, I would return to the peer tutoring program and volunteer my time just to help out fellow students</p>
<p>When the pandemic started looking like it would settle down, it was the start of my fourth and final year at this school. Luckily, school life would happen uneventfully as I worked to check off the last few major requirements and electives I needed to complete in order to graduate.</p>
