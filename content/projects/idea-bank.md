### Cumulative practice

This is the final project that I worked on during my college career. It came at the end of the final year of my schooling and would be a cumulative way to demonstrate project management, software design and implementation, and soft skills. The project was not provided by a the school or an internal source. Instead, a project sponsor was recruited to provide a unique and challenging project for us to complete.

This project that I selected to work on was a project called Idea Bank. This envisioned product was a platform similar to github that tracked to progression and inspiration of ideas. Ideas could be anything, from a new type of game to the next engine that would be in a car. A platform like this would provide a way to track the original ideas and inspiration of new ideas. It is meant to give social credit to contributor of innovative ideas.

As the final project during schooling, there was no micromanagement from any professors, nor did the project sponsor manage us. It was up to my team and I to manage the project and build the software that the sponsor was looking for. This proved to challenging indeed as this is a group of software engineering students that want to write code, not constantly reflect on things that have already happened. Although reflection and planning is a good thing, it was overemphasized during the project lifespan.

Internally, this project proved to be challenging in itself. Firstly, the team members were already highly specialized between certain technologies on the web stack. Secondly, other team members were not familiar with any technologies on the tech stack. Ultimately, the project became more of a one-on-one tutoring class for the team rather than an actual project.

Despite these challenges, a prototype web application and API services were built and seemed to be on the track that the sponsor was envisioning. However, the prototype is quite minimal, barely qualifying as an MVP, and has a lot more work to be done for it. This project experience did show me the entire process of building software at a professional level.
