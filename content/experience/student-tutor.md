### Helping others 

During college, I discovered an oppurtunity to help other students with coursework that I have already passed. This is beneficial for both me and the students that I helped. For me, it would be a good way to review the content that I have already covered. For the students, it provided them with a more relatable source to seek assistance with coursework (Talking to professors can sometimes can be daunting). This oppurtunity was presented during the midst of the covid-19 pandemic and was offered as a remote position.

As a tutor, I was able to assist with students for any lower division class that I had passed already. A tutor need not complete all lower division courses in order to participate in this oppurtunity. This was the case I was in. The first time that I had participated, I had only completed my first year programming courses. Despite this limited coverage of lower division courses, I still managed to tutor students in introductory programming courses. As I prograssed through the lower division courses, I also was able to tutor in more lower division courses.

Through my college career, I volunteered to tutor students several times. I tutored courses that varied from introductory programming courses to more specialized courses like assembly programming and data structures and algorithms. Each time that I tutored, I was able to grow my communications skills and problem solving skills. This was especially useful during the pandemic as most course work was asychronous and did not require much interactions beyond discussion boards.
