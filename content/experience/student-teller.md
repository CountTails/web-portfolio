### First professional computing

During my final year of high school, the oppurtunity to work as a student teller at a campus branch became available. The branch was operated by Union Bank (now US bank) and allowed a select group of students to work as a bank teller. Since foot traffic at a bank situated inside a high school campus was limited to faculty and students, most of the work consisted of improving professional skills. The few times that a customer did walk into the branch also provided hands on experience with working with customers.

The tasks I had to perform that helped improve professional skills revolved around educated fellow students about financial literacy topics and advertising bank products. In order to educate students about financial literacy, I had to create slide decks that visualized various points about financial literacy ranging from simple savings to responsible credit card use. Slide decks were often presented to classes of about 30-40 students, requiring me to practice and improve my public speaking ability. Creating slide decks required the use of power point software, allowing me to hone my skills with common office software.

When it came to advertising bank products, it would typically involve approaching students in the hallways and giving a quick informational talk about the product. This would be quite similar to what many would refer to as an "elevator pitch", except that the idea was not my own. Giving advertisements is the hallways was more difficult than the financial literacy presentations because the students were often challenging to engage. They would often walk away without hearing the full pitch. Nevertheless, having to engage into coversation with students on the fly helped tremedously to break many shy habits that I held onto prior to starting at this position.

The remainder of the the work revolved around actually working as a bank teller. As mentioned before, foot traffic was quite light, so there were not many oppurtunities to actually work with customers. To subsidize the experience, my supervisors and colleagues would act as customers and I would do the same for them. When real customers did walk it, I was well prepared to handle their requests.

This position was my first job that provided some form of compensation. In this case, a scholarship. While not exactly foundational to software engineering, it was an oppurtunity to learn more about computers than what was covered in school and my hobby of gaming. Having to refine skills of common office software is most useful as it is a basic computing skill. I also had to learn and use job related software to help perform my job. This was slighly more technical than anything that I had used a computer before. It was certainly a gateway to learn more about computers in general.
